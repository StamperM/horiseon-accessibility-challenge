# horiseon-accessibility-challenge

## Project Definition
This was my fist project using semantic HTML elements in place of the div element. By replacing the div's with appropriate elements will allow this site to be more accessible. 

##Credits 
Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. and the makers of our bootcamp for providing the 0riginal  HTML and CSS.
